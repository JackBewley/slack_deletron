# Slack Deletron

Slack is really rad and free. Problem is when you're part of a team, people upload a lot of gifs and then you go over your file upload limit.

Deleting each file is tedious. You have to click into each one and press delete. Sigh, too much.

So I built something. It exists at [reallygood.work/slack](http://reallygood.work/slack).

You can help me out or host it yourself.

## Working on it

Fork it at create your own app at [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com/applications). Use the client_id and client_secret provided to populate the variables in the main.js file.

Set the callback URI to be the callback.html file path. You can run a local server through the Gulp file.

## What? How do I?

I want you to learn and play around with this. If you get confused by anything, gimme a holler at [@drewisthe](http://twitter.com/drewisthe). I'll be glad to give you the deets.

## I don't like this/I could do it better/You should've used Angular/Why didn't you write it in another language?

I wrote it while sitting on my couch. If you can do it better, go nuts. I didn't try to make it the best, I just hacked it together and made something.
